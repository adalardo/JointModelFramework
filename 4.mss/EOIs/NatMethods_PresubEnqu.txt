Network theory allows us to understand complex systems by evaluating how their constituent elements interact with one another. It has been widely applied to many disciplines in biology, including ecology, where there is now a rich body of work describing the characteristics of food webs and other trophic interactions (Pimm and Lawton 1978, Lafferty et al. 2008, Dunne, Lafferty, et al. 2013). Fewer network approaches, however, focus on non-trophic or horizontal interactions occurring between elements on the same organisational level, for example between plants (Ellison 2019). Indeed, quantifying these interaction matrices from empirical data is challenging, as the number of potential interactions increases non-linearly as more elements are included, and not all interactions may be empirically observable when some elements are rare (Olesen et al. 2011). 

We present a novel modelling framework which estimates observed and unobserved interactions in diverse horizontal systems, using measures of individual performance in the absence and presence of their potential interaction partners. This method is illustrated with a case study on a diverse wildflower community, and is flexible to positive and negative interactions, as well as to a wide range of data from other horizontal complex systems. In turn, this framework facilitates the application of network theory tools to the management of horizontal systems, as well as to deepening our understanding of diversity, stability and other system-level properties which emerge from interactions.
