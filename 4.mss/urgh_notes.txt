INTRODUCTION
More references: intro of networks / interactions
                 throughout
Make the first two paragraphs meatier / more engaging (restructure sentences? active voice?...)
~700 words, reasonable length

RESULTS
~ 1700 words, too long?
Better explain why we don't compare results to association network
Add references to case study results (questions)
Place question 1 at the end??


DISCUSSION
~ 1500 words, too long?
Make first paragraph mroe relevant / interesting / tighter
Remove talk of foudnation species
Condense the two paragraphs on keystone / exotics in to one paragraph 
Improve link from question 1 -> diversity & stability, network tools -> facilitation - and figure out the best order for that! 
Lots of repition from results, not very interesting.. cut repeats / banalitudes, maybe push a bit further on some things? 
Conclusion is good - check it to refocus discussion

-- For Nature Methods, main text should be 2500-3500 words long
currently 400 words > 
-- For MEE, 6000-7000 total

METHODS -- solid (?)
~2170 words, good length
Rewrite to make more general to elements, not species / ecology?
REM -> RIM (for consistency with Compnet)

SUPPS
- Seed rate methods

FIGURES
- Figure 1 - black line to show median
- Figure 3 - add A/B/C




=> Once all of these have been done, send to Trace and Daniel for comments(?)
