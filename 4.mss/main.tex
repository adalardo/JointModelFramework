    \textbf{Network theory allows us to understand complex systems by evaluating how their constituent components interact with one another. Quantifying these interaction matrices from empirical data can be difficult however, because the number of potential interactions increases non-linearly as more components are included in the system, and not all interactions may be empirically observable when some components are rare. We present a novel modelling framework which estimates realised and unrealised interactions in diverse horizontal systems, using measures of individual component performance in the absence and presence of their potential interaction partners. We apply this framework to an ecological dataset of an annual wildflower community and quantify the competitive and facilitative effects of 52 neighbouring species on the viable seed production of 22 focal species. We illustrate how this method can be applied in an ecological context to better understand and manage plant communities, with potential applications of this framework extending beyond ecological systems.}

    \paragraph{}
    In many biological systems, interactions between various components affect each other's performance and together determine the dynamics of the whole system. In order to understand how system dynamics behave when many components are involved, such complex systems can be represented as networks where the components are nodes and linked by interactions. These nodes can take on a wide array of identities, including cells, individuals, populations or species. Likewise, interactions or links can operate via many different mechanisms and have a wide range of effects on the nodes. Fundamentally, biological networks have been observed to typically differ from randomly-assembled networks in important and varied ways, thus informing us on the biological processes structuring these systems \parencite{Dunne2002}.

    \paragraph{}
    %Need a section here describing horizontal / single-trophic systems and what some of the difficulties are for these. 
    Network theory has been widely applied to investigate the structure of food webs and other types of trophic interaction networks .. [specify this is for species?]

    There is now a rich body of work describing the characteristics of food webs, plant-pollinator networks, and host-parasite interactions, but non-trophic interactions such as those occurring between plants are largely neglected \parencite{Ellison2019}. This is unfortunate, as recent work indicates that non-trophic interactions and plant diversity alter food web structure, stability and diversity-functioning relationships \parencite{Hammill2015, Giling2019, Zhao2019, Miele2019}. Plant-plant interaction networks belong to a class of networks which can be described as horizontal: all nodes exist within the same level of organisation. The study of horizontal interaction networks provides it's own challenges: ....
    Integrating plant and trophic networks remains a key challenge in improving our understanding of community dynamics and persistence \parencite{Godoy2018c}.

    \paragraph{} 
    In many systems, interactions between nodes are not always easy to observe empirically and must instead be deduced through other means. One strategy is to look at associations between the nodes: nodes which are often found together are assumed to interact more strongly than nodes which rarely co-occur. This approach benefits from a wide range of packages available in R, requires fairly simple data (presence/absence of the nodes) and can be used to deduce associations between large numbers of nodes. An important drawback remains: association networks cannot always distinguish between the multiple confounding factors which lead to co-occurrence, and in ecological communities little evidence supports their use as a proxy for interactions \parencite{Sander2017,Barner2018, Thurman2019, Blanchet2020}.

    \paragraph{}
    An alternative approach is to directly quantify the effects of interacting nodes on the node of interest by evaluating its performance in the absence and presence of potential interaction partners. Performance can be any variable of interest which affects the dynamics of the system, for example population growth. The resulting interactions are phenomenological and thus not dependant on any specific mechanism, allowing us to capture a wide range of biological processes affecting the dynamics of the whole system. Such methods can quickly become data intensive and computationally complex, however, as the number of nodes $S$ increases and the number of potential direct interactions subsequently increases by $S^2$. Highly diverse systems pose a further challenge: the abundance distribution of different elements is typically skewed, with a few nodes making up the majority of abundances and a large number of nodes remaining rare \parencite{}. Given that data collection is limited in time and scope, interactions with rarer nodes especially may not be realised simply by chance, excluding them from analysis regardless of the role they might play. Empirically quantifying interaction matrices for diverse systems thus requires a method which is flexible to both a high number of nodes, and potential gaps in our records of interactions. 


    \paragraph{} % I'm not sur this paragraph will be necessary ... but it will need a little bit more work if I include it.
    We present a general framework to estimate interactions in highly diverse systems using Bayesian parameter estimation methods which are flexible to greater model complexity. We specify a multi-tiered model which allows us to estimate both realised and unrealised interactions. using annual wildflower community data in Western Australia consisting of 22 focal species and up to 52 neighbouring species. As a case study, we illustrate how this novel framework can be applied by couching the resulting interactions into established models of population dynamics. This allows us to account for other demographic processes affecting species performance, as well as translate interaction effects on the measured variable into effects on another variable of interest. We show how the resulting interaction matrices differ from an association network on the same data, and suggest potential applications in species management, xxx and yyyy  that make use of the rich information provided by species interaction networks.

    %Interactions between species can affect growth rates and population abundances, for example as a predator eats a prey or two plants compete for resources. Together, interactions between many species influence the dynamics of the whole community in ways which can determine patterns of species richness and abundance. In order to understand how community dynamics behave when many species are involved, ecologists can represent communities as networks \parencite{Pimm1978} where species are nodes and linked by interactions. This approach provides a broad view of how multiple species relate to one another within a community \parencite{Kefi2015}. As a result, ecological networks have been observed to typically differ from randomly-assembled networks in important and varied ways, thus informing us on the biological processes structuring these communities \parencite{Dunne2002}. 


    % \paragraph{}
    % Measuring non-trophic relationships in plant communities is difficult, in part because they cannot be directly observed as in food webs or other interaction networks, and must instead be inferred by other means. Arguably the most common approach to empirically quantifying interactions between a focal species and others involves measuring the effects of neighbours on a proxy for lifetime reproductive success (e.g. fecundity, growth rate) \parencite{Connell1961, Grace1990}. This can be done for example by growing focal species with neighbours of different identities and at varying densities, in the field or laboratory. The resulting phenomenological interaction strengths are not dependant on any specific mechanism and can be directly linked to changes in species abundances through the use of population dynamic models, for example with the Beverton-Holt model \parencite{Beverton1957, Levine2009}). This approach has been widely applied and has greatly improved our understanding of competition and its effects on biodiversity \parencite{Tilman1982, Chesson2000b, Levine2008, Adler2010, Mayfield2010a, Kraft2015} but remains limited to investigating interactions between few species, rather than a diverse community. The reason is two-fold: applying this method to a large number of species requires both large amounts of data and replication, as well as complex models which can be difficult to implement and run the danger of over-parameterisation. 

    % \paragraph{} 
    % A common alternative which is less demanding, and scalable to high-diversity systems is the use of association, or co-occurrence networks. Plant 'interactions' are inferred by measuring positive and negative spatial associations between species (e.g. \cite{Saiz2011}), resulting in networks which capture a variety of factors including biotic interactions \parencite{Losapio2019}. This approach requires data which is much more easily obtainable and can naturally handle a large number of species. A wide range of packages are available in R to deduce association networks, alongside further tools and methods to better infer plant interactions from spatial distribution patterns \parencite{Keil2019}, for example by including environmental covariates. Spatial association networks however, have been found to remain poor predictors of species interactions and rarely match empirical estimates \parencite{Sander2017,Barner2018, Thurman2019, Blanchet2020}.

    \subsection{Implementation of the joint model framework}

    % 1 or 2 paragraphs explaining what we did (the 'method') applied to the data 
    \paragraph{}
        To estimate pairwise interactions in diverse, horizontal systems such as those occurring between plant species in ecological communities, we developed a joint modeling framework capable of estimating both realised and unrealised interactions from empirical observational data of individual component performance in the absence and presence of neighbours. Realised interactions are those which can be directly measured from the collected data, for example as two plant species are observed to co-occur, their performance is evaluated in each other's presence and the effect of the interaction can thus be directly quantified from the observed data. To do so, the performance of an element - a species, population or any chosen set of replicated individuals - is regressed against the abundance and identity of it's neighbouring elements in a neighbour-density dependant model (NDDM).  Increases or decreases in an overall elements' performance can thus be attributed to neighbouring elements/species which were observed to co-occur. Key aspects of the resulting interaction matrix is that these interactions can be competitive or facilitative, non-symmetrical (the effect of species $i$ on $j$ does not necessarily match the effect of species $j$ on $i$) and include intraspecific effects (the effect of species $i$ on itself). Another versatile feature of this framework is that the shape of the relationship between performance and neighbour density can be easily modified to suit the system in question (linear, exponential, rectangular hyperbolic) though it should be carefully verified before implementation. 

    \paragraph{}
        Unrealised interactions on the other hand are those which cannot be directly measured from the collected data. As is common in ecological communities, rare elements may not be observed to co-occur with many neighbours, because data sampling is limited in space and time and rare species are not as likely to be found. This species may still, however, potentially interact with many of the other species in the system if given the opportunity to do so. Rather than assigning a 0 value to these unknown interactions, we used the previously quantified realised interactions from the NDDM to estimate those unrealised interactions. To do so, we assume that unrealised interactions can be simplified such that elements typically have a singular impact on and a singular response to neighbours independant of neighbour identity. An unrealised interaction is therefore the product of two elements' impact and response parameters. Impact and response are calculated from the realised interactions provided by the NDDM and their estimation contributes directly to the overall joint model log-likelihood. Note that the NDDM estimates a unique parameter for each realised interaction independantly of each elements's effects on other neighbours, whilst the response and impact model (RIM) applies only to those unrealised interactions. 


    \subsection{Parameter estimation and validation}

        \paragraph{}
        In order to allow a seamless integration between the NDDM and RIM and for both models to contribute to the likelihood, the joint model framework was written in the STAN programming language which uses Bayesian estimation methods. This approach is also more robust to the inclusion of many interactions without running as much risk of overparameterisation, and returns parameter estimates as distributions rather than point estimates, allowing for easy inclusion of uncertainty in the analysis of results. Model parameters were sampled 1000 times from the 80\% posterior confidence intervals to construct our parameter estimates. We conducted a posterior predictive check comparing simulated seed density to observed values (Figure \ref{fig:ppcheck}), this is especially important for verifying that the appropriate distribution and link function is being used for the data at hand. 



    \subsection{Application to case study data}

        The joint model was first applied to simulated data to verify that the original interaction parameters could be recovered by this framework. We then applied this model to a case study dataset of a diverse annual wildflower community, where elements consisted of 22 focal species and up to 52 neighbouring species (including focals). Seed production was used as a measure of performance and modeled with a negative binomial distribution. The model returned estimates for all 1144 interactions between those 22 focal species and 52 neighbouring species, of which 60\% were observed (realised).  When accounting for focal species only, 86.4\% of interactions were observed and estimated by the NDDM. NDDM and RIM estimates matched well and followed similar distributions (S.I. Figure \ref{fig:adist}) as enforced by the framework.

    %         \item interaction estimates for the REM peak around 0 - which can only occur if $r_i$ or $e_j$ are 0 - can discuss when this might occur (1. there exists true 0's such that some species have no effects on others - 2. some species might have both positive and negative effects so averages to 0 - 3. prior is centered on 0 and signal is too weak to be picked up)

        \label{fig:ppcheck}
    \end{figure}
  

    \subsection{Building an interaction matrix}
    
    \paragraph{}
    We applied bootstrap sampling to each posterior interaction strength distribution to create 1000 samples of the community interaction matrix. This interaction matrix captures the likely effects of neighbours on the performance of focal elements. Differences in the magnitude of these interaction terms reflect differences in intrinsic performance (performance in the absence of neighbours, either competitive or facilitative) of the focal species. In order to make interactions comparable between species, interaction terms can be rescaled by dividing them by the returned values for intrinsic performance. 


    In our example, this would be seed production in the absence of neighbours, but could equally be biomass, height for example. For our case study, the resulting interaction matrix was non-symmetrical and included both positive (competitive) and negative (facilitative) values (Figure \ref{fig:netwks}. A \& B). Though competition was the dominant interaction type,  35\% of all focal x neighbour rescaled interactions were facilitative, as were 26 \% of all focal x focal interactions (averages across all network samples). As a result, 40\% of interactions between pairs of focal species were of opposing signs such that $i$ competes with $j$ but $j$ facilitates $i$. 


    Furthermore, the elements of the diagonal (the effect of a component on itself) were able to be estimated, which can allow us to quantify how much a species regulates it's own performance. For 12 of our 22 focal species, the scaled distributions of these intraspecific effects did not overlap with 0, which suggests individuals of those species have a non-trivial effect on other individuals of the same species. Together, these features make the resulting interaction matrix qualitatively different to association networks, which are a common alternative to inferring interactions in diverse systems (Figure \ref{fig:netwks}. C).

    \subsection{Effects on system behaviour: integration into models of component dynamics}

    [THIS IS WHERE I BRING UP THE 'PROPER' SCALING - though the numbers presented previously rely on pop dyn model alphas, I thought that bringing all of this up earlier wouldn't fit the results quite so well. FEEL FREE TO DISAGREE]


    \paragraph{}
    In order to understand how the returned interaction matrix may affect system-wide behaviour, it may be necessary to couch interaction estimates into models of component dynamics. In the wildflower case study illustrated here, models of plant population dynamics are necessary to translate interaction effects on seed production (what is measured) to interaction effects on growth rates and thus future abundance patterns. Using a system-appropriate population dynamic model to guide us, we incorporated key species-specific demographic rates (seed survival and germination rate) into the rescaling of the interaction effects to return \textit{per-capita} interaction strengths. We showcase this process in the Methods, but the exact steps and rescaling needed will vary according to the model chosen. [DISCUSS BENEFITS OF THIS FURTHER IN THE DISCUSSION] 

    \paragraph{}
    Potentially a short paragraph on 'network' results (weighted connectance, transitivity) so that I can later discuss how the scaling + network theory can allow us to link network patterns to diversity / stability etc. Basically scaling into per-capita is necessary if we want to make inferrences about diversity maintenance or stability. \\
    We calculated .... 

    \paragraph{}
    These per-capita interaction strengths allow us to draw inferrences about how components may affect each other's growth rather than performance. On average, an individual of a different species decreased a focal individual's growth rate by X\% (+- give min and max), wheras an individual of the same species decreased a focal individual's growth rate by X\% (+- give min and max). Overall, 85\% of all wildlfower species across all network samples were found to compete with themselves and therefore regulate their own population abundance, though the strength of per-capita intraspecific interactions was not correlated to abundance (Figure \ref{fig:aii_abund}. Figure further \ref{fig:species} illustrates how the use of per-capita interaction strengths can allow us to draw conclusions about how different species integrate into and affect other components of the system.  

    \paragraph{}

            \item Do abundant natives under-regulate their population density compared to rarer natives? \\
            Answer: No, POCA and VERO are very close to the median value for self-regulation
            \item Which species take on keystone roles aka low abundance but high impact on others? \\
            Answer: TROR (facilitative), HAOD, GITE (extreme competitor)
            \item Though exotic species are typically thought to compete with natives, there are also reports of facilitative exotics. Is this the case in our system? \\
            Answer: PEIA facilitates more and competes less than the median species

\section{Discussion}
    
% word count aim: 500-1000


    \paragraph{} 
    The framework presented here allows the estimation of diverse interaction matrices from horizontal community data. Given individual observations of performance and the identity of the local neighbourhood, our model uses Bayesian regression to quantify the competitive or facilitative effects of one component on another and vice versa. Several aspects of our model and its implementation allow us to better capture complex features of ecological communities compared to co-occurrence networks. Like co-occurrence networks, our framework is flexible to the inclusion of many species. Unlike co-occurrence networks however, interactions in our model are estimated from species effects on each other's performance.  This method opens possibilities for many types of applications depending on the system chosen.

    % \subsection{Applications to ecosystem management}

    \paragraph{}
    Interaction networks provide a unique lens with which to examine an ecological community. By describing how species are linked, networks can for example be used to evaluate ecosystem response to human-altered landscapes and guide future management decisions \parencite{Ross2011} or explore how communities may respond to global warming \parencite{Gorman2019}. Specifically, couching species-rich interaction matrices into models of population dynamics allow us to compare how community dynamics may affect and respond to individual species. This can direct ecosystem management efforts such as prioritising certain species to conserve, or eradicating invasives which are disruptful to native species community dynamics. 

    [MERGE THE FOLLOWING 3 PARAGRAPHS]

    \paragraph{}
    Certain species play important roles in the community which can be deduced from their position in the interaction network \parencite{Cirtwill2018a}. Keystone species for example typically have low abundance but disproportionately strong effects on the rest of the community \parencite{Power1996}. Foundation species on the other hand are locally abundant and have important, sometimes facilitative effects on other species population dynamics \parencite{Ellison2019}. Figure \ref{fig:species}.A. identifies several contenders for keystone (orange diamonds) or foundation (blue diamonds) species status based on their community abundance and net interaction effects across all neighbours. Likewise, the integration of exotic species into native communities can also be evaluated using interaction networks. In our case study, two out of three exotic species (red diamonds in Fig. \ref{fig:species}) were extremely abundant but had substantially different effects on neighbours, with the grass \textit{Pentameris airoides} facilitating some species, whereas \textit{Arctotheca calendula} had almost exclusively competitive effects on all other neighbours (Fig. \ref{fig:species}.B.). These examples are not exhaustive, but serve to illustrate how interaction matrices can help us understand what roles specific species play within a community. 
    %     % Because some species have stronger effects on other species abundances and are more crucial to the maintenance of biodiversity, management efforts can be prioritised towards their conservation. 

    %         \paragraph{} % MOVED FROM RESULTS
    %         One potential use for translating interaction estimates into per-capita interaction strengths is to identify species of particular importance to the healthy functioning of the whole community. 


         \paragraph{}
     Keystone species for example are both crucial to maintaining the organisation and diversity of their community, and have exceptionally strong effects on other species \parencite{Mills1993}, often leading to secondary extinctions when they are removed from a network. Their influence on the abundance of other species and wider community dynamics is disproportionately high compared to their biomass \parencite{Power1996, Piraino2002, Libralato2006}, which allows easy identification of potential keystone species from our network results (Fig. \ref{fig:species}) though further tests are recommended for validation. Foundation species also control local biodiversity but are widely connected, locally abundant and hold a unique position in regards to their effects on community dynamics \parencite{Ellison2005, Baiser2013, Ellison2019}. Though it can take many years of careful study to identify foundation species from abundant species which are not as crucial to community structure, our framework can help distinguish species which are abundant and interact weakly with neighbours from common species which have strong competitive and facilitative effects on the community. Identifying keystone, foundation and other important types of species roles is helpful for maintaining biological diversity, ecosystem integrity and functioning, especially in response to disturbances and other stresses \parencite{Nyakatya2008, Orwin2016, Losapio2017, Narwani2019}.
    %     % [The two species were \textit{Gilberta tenuifolia} and \textit{Haloragis odontocarpa} in case that's interesting.]

    \paragraph{}
    Network approaches can also be used to evaluate how specific species are integrated within the community. Our case study for example illustrates how different exotic species can have widely varying competitive and facilitative effects on neighbours (Fig. \ref{fig:species}). Though many invasive species compete with natives \parencite{Naeem2000, Riley2008, Zheng2015}, several studies have found evidence of invasives facilitating natives, with cascading effects on other species and net positive effects on ecosystem processes \parencite{Rodriguez2006, Ramus2017}. Alternatively, threatened species could also benefit from this type of analysis. Recent work suggests rare species are the prime emitters and beneficiaries of facilitative interactions, forming mutualistic refuges from competitive dominants \parencite{Calatayud2019, Hines2020}. Identifying neighbouring species which facilitate and increase the local abundance of rarer, endangered target species is one of many strategies which could help guide conservation management.


    % \subsection{Understanding community diversity and stability}

    %     \paragraph{}
    %     Quantifying the matrix of per-capita interaction strengths between species in horizontal communities allows us to explore how the mechanisms maintaining diversity and stability operate in these systems and across a broad number of species. Self-regulation, for example, is an extremely important driver of community stability \parencite{Barabas2017} and arises from how individuals of the same species interact with one another. Whereas same-species effects cannot be estimated by association networks, our framework quantifies intraspecific interactions and allows us to measure the strength and prevalence of competitive and facilitative density-dependence. Measures of intra and interspecific interactions can also allow us to estimate niche overlap between species (for an example, see \cite{Chu2015a}): weak interactions between species suggests they are not sharing or competing for many resources, and occupy different niche spaces in the community. Strong competitive self-regulation, and weak interactions between two species, are two of many mechanisms leading to stability and diversity in plant communities.

    % In addition to explicitely allowing for many species interactions, including both competitive (Figure \ref{fig:netwks}.A) and facilitative (Figure \ref{fig:netwks}.B) interactions is another feature which distinguishes our framework from traditional approaches to plant community ecology. Plant population dynamic models typically force interactions to be competitive, despite rising evidence that facilitation is common and an important driver of plant community dynamics \parencite{Brooker2008a}.

    %     \paragraph{}
    %     A key feature of our model framework is the inclusion of facilitative interactions, which have long been disregarded in plant population models and theoretical frameworks of plant diversity-maintenance. The importance of facilitative interactions to community structure and patterns of abundance has long been recognised \parencite{Callaway1997a} but there is still little consensus on how they may affect biodiversity \parencite{Bruno2003}. Recent work suggests facilitation may be more widespread than expected \parencite{Gross2015, Picoche2020} and can  benefit species diversity and stability depending on the circumstances \parencite{Coyte2015, Brooker2008}. Our framework provides a means to investigate the prevalence and strength of facilitation across multiple species, and how it may act in relation to competition and species diversity.  
        
    %     \paragraph{}
    %     Ultimately, quantifying plant interaction networks allows us to apply tools from network theory which will help us understand not only how plants interact, but also how these interactions drive community-level patterns of abundance and diversity. Several metrics already exist for describing network structure such as weighted connectance \parencite{Ulanowicz1991} or relative intransitivity \parencite{Laird2006a}, though these are fewer than for trophic or unweighted networks networks (e.g. \cite{Bersier2002, Delmas2019}). Adapting measures of nestedness or modularity for example to non-sparse networks (as plant communities typically are) would allow us to further characterise how interactions and species are organised. These metrics relate to various aspects of stability and could greatly inform us on how diversity is maintained between plants. 

        %Likewise, networks also provide several ways of measuring and describing species roles in their respective communities \parencite{Cirtwill2018a} for example through the use of structural motifs, unique patterns of interacting species which together make up the whole network. Motifs have been found to have important biological meaning in food webs \parencite{Bascompte2005a} but remain to be identified for single-trophic and bipartite networks.

   \subsection{Limitations}
        
        \paragraph{}
        Though our framework does provide a way of estimating interactions between system components which are not observed to cooccur, care should be taken that these unrealised interactions do not dominate a resulting network. The method we propose uses observed interactions to estimate simpler parameters which allow us to approximate the remaining interactions. This method thus works better the more observed interactions we have with which to estimate the unobserved ones, and the more reliable those observed estimates are. It is also important to consider the likely reasons for missing interactions. Forbidden links are a subset of potential interactions which cannot be observed, often due to physical constraints (e.g. biological mismatch) or spatio-temporal uncoupling. For example, a pair of short-lived annual plants might have such opposing phenologies that their growing season never overlaps in the field. This type of interaction would be assigned a 0 value. We direct the reader towards the literature on forbidden interactions \parencite{Olesen2011, Jordano2016} for solving these cases. 

        \paragraph{}
        Our model framework is aimed to helping empiricists who would like to estimate species interactions in non-trophic communities. Though the MCMC sampling algorithm does allow for many parameters to be estimated, it is crucial to check chain-mixing and model behaviour to verify that the full parameter space is sampled. The amount of data required for sampling diverse communities may still be substantial as we do not recommend fewer than 20 observations per focal species. Grouping species which appear very rarely is also a common strategy to avoid over-parameterisation. In our case study, neighbour species which were recorded fewer than 10 times across all observations were grouped into an 'other' category with its own interaction effect. If interactions with or between very rare species are the explicit object of interest however, data-collection can simply be focused on amassing observations of focal individuals from those rarer species to be able to estimate these interaction strengths.   

\section{Conclusion}

    \paragraph{} 
     By providing a method whith which to estimate interactions in horizontal systems, we hope to help empiricists who would like to ...


    
\section{Methods}

\textbf{Note: I've left the species / fitness nomenclature throughout and added a little sentence explaining why as I'm not sure that switching to components/performance will make it any clearer - happy to take advice on which makes more sense though}
    
    \paragraph{}
    The joint model framework was initially developed for an ecological dataset where interacting species affect each other's lifetime reproductive success. As such we refer to network components or nodes as 'species' and node performance as 'lifetime reproductive success' or 'fitness' however this framework is not limited to ecological datasets and can be applied to data from interacting components (e.g. populations or groups of individuals) which meet the following criteria: 
    \begin{itemize}
        \item observations of focal individuals record a proxy for performance, for example seed production, biomass or stem diameter growth as a proxies for lifetime reproductive success
        \item these observations also record the identity and abundance of neighbours within the interaction neighbourhood of each focal individual
        \item observations are spatially replicated across several individuals for each focal component or species
    \end{itemize}

    In addition to these requirements, any experimental design or data which may reduce confounding effects between environment and competition will provide more accurate estimates of interaction effects (e.g. thinning certain plots, recording environmental data known to affect performance). 
    
    \subsection{Neighbour density-dependant model}
        
        \paragraph{}
        We begin by implementing a neighbour density-dependant model (NDDM) to each focal species $i$ which regresses the identity and abundance of neighbours $j$ ($j = 1, 2, 3, ..., S$) against the measured proxy for lifetime reproductive success $P_{i}$:
        
        \begin{equation}
        P_{i} = \beta_{i0} - \sum_{j=1}^{S} \beta_{ij} N_{j}
        \label{nddm}
        \end{equation}
        
        The intercept $\beta_{i0}$ represents intrinsic fitness, a species' fitness in the absence of interactions with neighbours. $N_{j}$ are the abundances of neighbours recorded for each observation, and the $\beta_{ij}$ represent the species-specific effect of each neighbour $j$ on $i$. Note that neighbours can include conspecifics, in which case intraspecific interactions are denoted as $\beta_{ii}$.

        \paragraph{}
        [DISCUSS GLM AND LINK FUNCTION HERE]. Bring up that this is run as a glm, so you have to choose an appropriate distribution and link function - the relationship between $P_i$ and the righ-hand side of the equation does not need to be linear! In our case, it definitely wasn't.
              
    \subsection{Unrealised links}
    
        \paragraph{}
        In any given site or year, a focal species may only be observed to interact with a subset of potential interaction partners, which means the NDDM above will not be able to estimate all potential interactions ($\beta_{ij}$) between species. This is especially true for rare species. These \textit{unrealised} interactions can be estimated by using an alternative model with a different set of assumptions to the NDD model. This model is described as the response-effect model (here called the response-impact model or RIM) by Godoy, Kraft and Levine (2014) and assumes that each species has the same effect on all neighbours regardless of their identity, as well as the same response to competition regardless of competitor identity. 
        
        \begin{equation}
        P_{i} = \beta_{i0} - r_{i} \sum_{j=1}^{S} e_{j} N_{j}
        \label{rim}
        \end{equation}
        
        Pairwise interactions which are missing from Eq. 1 can be approximated by Eq. 2 by multiplying the relevant $r_{i}$ and $e_{j}$ such that $\beta_{ij} = r_{i} e_{j}$. In order to allow both the NDDM and REM interaction estimates to contribute to the likelihood, we first used the NDDM to quantify observed interactions and then used those to estimate species-specific $r$ and $e$ parameters such that: 
    
        \begin{equation}
        r_i e_j \sim logistic \left ( \beta_{ij}, \sigma \right )
        \label{unrealised}
        \end{equation}
    
        where $\sigma$ is a community-level scale parameter for the logistic distribution. We use a logistic distribution here because the heavier tails make it a slightly weaker informative prior than a normal distribution. $\sigma$ defines how widely the tails extend and can be expressed in terms of the standard deviation. 

    \subsection{Standardising effects into per-capita interactions}

        The $\beta_{ij}$ and $r_i e_j$ estimates returned by the framework describe the effect of species $j$ on the proxy for lifetime reproductive fitness of species $i$. Differences in the magnitude of these interaction terms may thus reflect differences in reproductive fitness, which can vary widely both between species and under different environmental conditions. In order to make the effects of interactions comparable between species, the interaction terms returned by both models above can be transformed into \textit{per-capita} interaction strengths \parencite{Godoy2014, Bimler2018}. The appropriate scaling is determined by writing the neighbour density-dependant model (Eq. \ref{nddm}) into a form equivalent to a Lotka-Volterra competition model: 

        \begin{equation}
        P_{i} = \beta_{i0} \left ( 1 - \sum_{j=1}^{S} {\beta_{ij}}'' N_{j} \right )
        \label{LVform}
        \end{equation}

        This reveals that our interaction terms can be rescaled into per-capita interaction strengths by dividing them with the recipient species' intrinsic fitness:  

        \begin{equation}
        {\beta_{ij}}'' = \frac{\beta_{ij}}{\beta_{i0}}
        \label{scaling}
        \end{equation}

        where $\beta_{ij}$ can be replaced with $r_i e_j$ when appropriate. Though this scaling step is not strictly necessary, per capita interaction strengths have the benefit of being directly comparable both across species and across environmental contexts where reproductive fitness may vary \parencite{Wootton2005}, leading to a wider range of potential applications.

    \subsection{Integrating species-level differences in demographic rates / Integrating interaction strengths into models of population dynamics}

    \textbf{this section and the justification below still needs some work}

        \paragraph{}
        In certain instances, models of population dynamics can be used to further extend the usefulness of the framework presented here. We suggest two cases where such an application may be useful. Firtly, the variable chosen to measure the performance of focal individuals $F_i$ may not always directly translate into estimates of lifetime reproductive success due to inherent practical constraints with collecting empirical data. For example, certain life-history reproductive strategies may lead to measures of high seed production in the field which do not account for low seed or seedling survival rates post-observation. In these cases, population dynamics models can be used to account for species-specific demographic rates into estimates of interaction effects. Alternatively, we might be more interested in the effects of neighbours on the abundance or growth rate of a focal species rather than on it's proxy for lifetime reproductive success. In this scenario, a population dynamic model can be used to translate interation effects on the measured variable into interaction strengths affecting the variable of interest. [THIS MIGHT ALMOST BE BETTER IN THE DISCUSSION?]

        \paragraph{}
        In both cases, an established population dynamic model is required as well as knowledge of any crucial demographic rates ..
        ... This step is illustrated in our case study below, where an annual plant population dynamic model is used to transform effects on wildfower seed production (the measured proxy for lifetime reproductive success) into effects on ...., and include species-specific estimates of seed germination and surival rates. 

    

        \paragraph{}
        Though this rescaling is not necessary when interactions are quantified as effects on rates such as growth or biomass accumulation, it is particularly useful in cases where $F_i$ is captured by variables which are affected by r/K reproductive strategies, such as seed or fruit production. Species $i$ for example may produce a high number of seeds of which few are viable, whereas species $j$ produces very few seeds though these are much more likely to mature into reproductive adults. Scaling the interaction terms returned by the models allows us to compare how species $i$ and $j$ both respond to interactions, relative to 

        Depending on the nature of the proxy chosen, this between-species variation in $F_i$ may not capture true differences in the fitness of each species, but rather differences in reproductive strategies for example due to r/K tradeoffs. 

        In these cases, differences in $F_i$ between species (and thus in the magnitude of the interaction terms) may be driven by differences in the amount of fruit or seed produced which do not account for...  [ALSO MOVE TO DISCUSSION?] 




    \subsection{Model fitting}

        \paragraph{}        
        The NDDM (Eq. 1) and the REM (Eqs. 2 and 3) can be implemented as generalised linear models in STAN \parencite{Carpenter2017}, a Bayesian statistical language where coefficient values will be estimated by MCMC sampling. The advantage of this approach is two-fold: the model can converge and coefficients can be estimated despite high model complexity and a large number of parameters. Using STAN requires translating the model formula into the STAN language, setting priors for parameters to be estimated, and using an indexing system to identify \textit{realised} interactions which are then fed into the REM. We provide a working example of the STAN file used to specify and set this model to the case study below in the Supplementary Information, as well as a generalisable function in R which prepares the data and required indexing. From the model file, only the link function for $F_i$ and it's parameterisation need to be modified in order to apply it to a different model or system. Additionally, non-integer measures of performance (e.g. biomass) should be redefined as real rather than integers in the data block. In the code given, a negative binomial distribution is used to fit seed production ($F_i$) but a different distribution may be more appropriate when using other proxies for lifetime reproductive success.   

        \paragraph{}
        STAN returns parameters as distributions which maximise the likelihood, and are conditioned by the data and priors. Priors describe the distribution of plausible values which these parameters may take. For an introduction to Bayesian inference which relates the use of priors to frequentist hypothesis testing, see \textcite{Ellison1996}. We recommend investigators experiment with setting different informed priors to both improve model convergence and verify the robustness of parameter estimates. The resulting parameters are termed posterior distributions, and samples from the posterior are drawn for analysis. \textcite{Ellison2004} also provides an accessible review of parameter estimate and the use of posterior distributions using a worked example on ant species richness data.

        %----------------------------------

    \section{Case study}

        We applied the model framework described above to a case study of annual wildflower plants. After quantifying the interaction matrix, we scale all interaction samples using estimates of intrinsic fitness ($\beta_{i0}$) and experimentally-measured species demographic rates. The scaling is determined by a system-appropriate population dynamic model and allows us to translate the interaction matrix into per-capita effects on  abundance. This transformation places the resulting interaction strengths on the same scale and allows us to compare the community-wide effects of different species, amongst other potential applications further illustrated in the Results and Discussion. 
        % Maybe add justification for applying it to plant data here -  possibly add that we assume all nodes 'perform' in the same way. (ie applicable to horizontal systems)


        \subsection{Data}

        \paragraph{}
        We applied this framework to annual wildflower community dataset from Western Australia. This system is a diverse and well-studied community of annual plants which germinate, grow, set seed and die within approximately 4 months every year. Individual fecundity data were collected in 2016, when 100 50 x 50 cm plots established in the understory of West Perenjori Reserve (29$^o$28'01.3"S 116$^o$12'21.6"E) were monitored over the length of the full field season, from July to October. The resulting dataset contains from 29 to over 1000 counts of individual plant seed production from 22 different focal species (with a median of 108 observations per species), in addition to the identity and abundances of all neighbouring individuals within the interaction neighbourhood of the focal plant. Interaction neighbourhoods varied in radius from 3 to 5 cm depending on the size of the focal species. Total neighbourhood diversity was 71 wildlfower species, 19 of which were recorded fewer than 10 times across the whole dataset. The species-specific effects of this latter group of species on focals were deemed negligible due to their extremely low abundance, they were thus grouped into an 'other' category and their effects on focals averaged. This resulted in 53 potential neighbour identities. Half of all plots were thinned (a quarter to 60\% diversity and a quarter to 30\%) to mitigate possible confounding effects between plot location and plant density, and did not target any particular species.

        \paragraph{} 
        We required species demographic rates (seed and germination) in order to scale model interaction estimates into per-capita interaction strengths. Species demographic rates for 16 of our focal species were estimated from a database of field experiments carried out between 2016 and 2019 where seedbags were placed in the field to estimate germination rates, and ungerminated seeds were evaluated in the lab for survivability. The remaining species were assigned mean demographic rates from these experiments. 

        \subsection{Model fitting}

        \paragraph{}
        We fit the model using R version 3.6.3, STAN and the rstan package \parencite{R2020, Carpenter2017, Rstan2020}. Estimates of seed production were fit with a negative binomial distribution. The model was run with 4 chains of 5000 iterations each, discarding the first 1000. Models were checked for convergence and traceplots were visually inspected to verify good chain behaviour and mixing. Model parameters were sampled 1000 times from the 80\% posterior confidence intervals to construct our parameter estimates. We then applied bootstrap sampling from each resulting interaction strength distribution to create 1000 samples of the community interaction network.

        \subsection{A model for annual plant population dynamics}

        \paragraph{}
        The above model framework returns species-specific estimates of intrinsic fitness ($\beta_{i0}$), as well as as a species x neighbour matrix of observed ($\beta_{ij}$) and unobserved ($r_i e_j$) interaction estimates which quantify the effects of one neighbour $j$ on the intrinsic fitness of a focal species $i$. Though useful as they are, these estimates can lead to a wider range of potential applications when integrated into models of population dynamics. For example, we might be more interested in the effects of neighbours on the abundance or growth rate of a focal species rather than on it's proxy for lifetime reproductive success. Importantly, it is necessary to specifiy a model describing population dynamics in order to draw conclusions about the effects of interactions and network structure on the maintenance of community diversity and stability. 

        \paragraph{} 
        We defined the following model for annual plants with a seed bank \parencite{Levine2009, Mayfield2017, Bimler2018} which describe the rate of change in a focal species' \textit{i} abundance of seeds in a seed bank from one year to the next: 
    
            \begin{equation}
                \frac{N_{i, t+1}}{N_{i, t}} = \left( 1 - g_{i} \right) s_{i} + g_{i}F_{i, t}
                \label{ifm}
            \end{equation}
        
        where \(F_{i,t}\) measures the number of viable seeds produced per germinated individual whilst \(g_{i}\) and \(s_{i}\) are the seed germination and seed survival rate, respectively. In a simplified case where the focal species \textit{i} interacts with only one other species \textit{j}, in this model of population dynamics \(F_{i,t}\) is given by:

            \begin{equation}
                F_{i,t} = \lambda_{i} e^{- \alpha_{ii} g_{i} N_{i, t} -  \alpha_{ij} g_{j} N_{j, t} }
                \label{fecundity}   
            \end{equation}

        where \(\lambda_{i}\) corresponds to seed number in the absence of competition, and \(\alpha_{ii}\) and \(\alpha_{ij}\) are the interaction strengths between species \(i\) and its intraspecific and interspecific neighbours respectively. Here it is \(\alpha_{ij} g_{j}\) and \(\alpha_{ii} g_{i}\) which are equivalent to \(\beta_{ij}\) in Eq. \ref{nddm}. 
        We determine the scaled, per-capita interaction strengths ${\alpha}''$'s by including \(\lambda_{i}\), \(g_{i}\) and \(s_{i}\) in such a way that these variables are cancelled out when the ${\alpha}''$'s are substituted for the $\alpha$'s in our annual plant population model. 

        \begin{equation}
            {\alpha_{ij}}'' = \frac{g_{j} \alpha_{ij}}{ln(\eta_{i})}
        \end{equation}

        with $\eta_{i} = \frac{\lambda_{i} g_{i}}{\theta_{i}}$ and $\theta_{i} = 1 - (1 - g_{i})(s_{i})$. % \(ln(\eta_{i})\) is thus equivalent to \(\beta_{i0}\) in Eqs. \ref{nddm} and \ref{scaling}.
        Note that because our model evaluates the rate of change of seeds in the seed bank, 'per-capita' here refers to changes 'per seed in the seed bank' of a focal species. Substituting ${\alpha}''$'s for $\alpha$'s in Eq. \ref{ifm} gives us: 
        
        \begin{equation}
            \frac{N_{i, t+1}}{N_{i, t}} = (1 - \theta_{i}) + \theta_{i} \eta_{i} e^{-ln(\eta_{i})({\alpha_{ii}}'' N_{i, t} + {\alpha_{ij}}'' N_{j, t})}
        \end{equation}

        where we can see that the ${\alpha}''$'s are directly proportional to the abundance of neighbours. Relating this population model to the joint model framework, we recover the following: 

        \begin{equation}
        {\beta_{ij}}'' = {\alpha_{ij}}''
        \end{equation}

        \begin{equation}
        \beta_{ij} = g_{j} \alpha_{ij}
        \end{equation}

        \begin{equation}
        \beta_{i0}  = ln(\eta_{i}) = ln(\frac{\lambda_{i} g_{i}}{\theta_{i}})
        \end{equation}

        % \begin{equation}
        % P_{i, t} = g_i F_{i, t} = ln(g_i F_{i, t})
        % \end{equation}

        % which one is it - and how does it match the code?!

        As we show here, the exact form of the rescaled interactions as well as intrinsic fitness can therefore vary depending on the specific population dynamic model applied and may include other demographic rates which reflect species-level differences in growth and mortality. Because intrinsic fitness is estimated by the model framework and not directly observed, we used the mean of the $\lambda_{i}$ posterior distribution returned by our model in our scaling of the interaction coefficients.


        % Using an appropriate model of population dynamics, the raw interaction estimates can be scaled into per-capita effects (${\beta}''$) which are directly comparable between species \parencite{Godoy2014, Bimler2018}. % Note that this step depends on a population dynamic model which can link species abundance to the chosen measure of fitness, and may require species-specific measures of certain key demographic rates (e.g. mortality, seedling survival) to scale the interactions.

        % \paragraph{}
        % In order to determine the appropriate scaling for the interaction estimates returned by our framework, we transform the model into a form equivalent to a Lotka-Volterra competition model: 

        % \begin{equation}
        % F_{i} = \beta_{i0} \left ( 1 - \sum_{i}^{j} {\beta_{ij}}'' N_{j} \right )
        % \label{LVform}
        % \end{equation}

        % This gives us the scaled interaction strengths: 
 
        % \begin{equation}
        % {\beta_{ij}}'' = \frac{\beta_{ij}}{\beta_{i0}}
        % \label{scaling}
        % \end{equation}

        % \paragraph{}
        % For this case study, we adapted the framework described here to work with a well-supported annual plant population model with a seed bank \parencite{Bimler2018}. The model describes changes in the rate of a focal species' seeds in the seed bank from one year to the next, which can be linked to $F_i$ through species-specific demographic rates (equations for the annual plant model are further described in Chapter 4). The exact form of the rescaled interactions can thus vary depending on the specific population dynamic model applied and may include other demographic rates which reflect species-level differences in growth and mortality.
